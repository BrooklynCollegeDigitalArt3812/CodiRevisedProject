      <p><center><strong>Nathan Explosion</strong> has extraordinary talent in music and is Dethklok's main  songwriter. His often violent lyrics are able to move large audiences into mass  hysteria. <br>
        Nathan is apparently a  lead songwriting force in Dethklok (despite Murderface's claims otherwise) and  demonstrates specific knowledge of music and songwriting.&nbsp;During  Dethklok's travels, Nathan comes up with violent ideas for song material, which  he records on a portable digital recording device.<br>
      Although the singer and  frontman of the band, Nathan has displayed little other music talent outside of  his vocal contributions. However, he is the only band member who actually  &quot;knows&quot; what the sound of Dethklok is, whereas the other band members  don't mind if a song is on the album which is not the &quot;Dethklok  sound&quot;. </p>

    <div class="col-md-6 text-justify">
      <p><strong>Toki Wartooth</strong>, in conjunction with his personality and role in the band, is  the only member who has no prior <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble#Rock_and_pop_bands">band</a> experience. He plays using a normal black standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_Flying_V">Gibson Flying V</a> in the first few seasons. However, in later seasons he uses the  all white <a href="http://dethklok.wikia.com/wiki/Brendon_Small_%22Snow_Falcon%22_Flying_V">Brendon Small  &quot;Snow Falcon&quot; Flying V</a>,  which becomes Toki's signature guitar later on.<br>
        Demonstrating effective  rhythm guitar styling, Toki's guitar line provides supporting chords and  flourishes to strengthen and harmonise with Skwisgaar's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_guitar">lead guitar</a> parts. As proven during Toki's audition, his main reason for  being in the band is that he is able to bring out the better qualities in  Skwisgaar's own guitar skills; he was the only auditionee who could challenge  Skwisgaar enough to raise the standard of his playing to even greater heights.  Sometimes Toki follows behind guitar solos in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_and_response_(music)">call-and-response</a> manner.<br>
        Toki may very well be the  only guitarist capable of keeping up with Skwisgaar, pretty much making him the  world's second fastest guitarist (which is further evidenced by his audition  for Dethklok, where he holds his own against Skwisgaar much longer than any  other guitarist). Toki apparently never practises guitar, but manages to  maintain his standard of playing regardless. <br>
        Often what he is good at  is done without practice or experience nor having a desire at all in.<br>
      As well as guitar, Toki  has been known to play the keyboard and can be heard in various songs including  &quot;Castratikron&quot; and &quot;Go Forth and Die&quot;.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6 text-justify">
      <p><strong>Pickles</strong>, sometimes called <strong>Pickles the Drummer</strong>, is a powerful speed-drummer,  known for his rhythmic double-kick techniques. It is said in an interview with  Dethklok that Pickles played drums at a young age, stating that the tornadoes  in the mid-west always forced him to take apart his drum set and reconstruct  them in the basement. It is unknown how he became the drummer for Dethklok.  However, his producing abilities are trusted enough by frontman <a href="http://dethklok.wikia.com/wiki/Nathan_Explosion">Nathan Explosion</a> that Pickles is an integral part of the recording and mixing  process on all of Dethklok's albums. Pickles occasionally does vocals for  Dethklok, acting as a back-up singer to Nathan. The best examples of this are  in the songs &quot;<a href="http://dethklok.wikia.com/wiki/Hatredcopter">Hatredcopter</a>&quot;, in which he shares vocal duties with Nathan, and &quot;Blazing  Star,&quot; in which he sings the bridge leading to the chorus. <br>
      He is also seen playing an  acoustic guitar from time to time, and piano in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&ved=0CEoQtwIwBA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXKS2gbbWonI&ei=r2zFUvjACNfcoASsn4Jw&usg=AFQjCNECAin2_k4F0BWNkjQsccyzhfySvQ&sig2=DcSTM19VCkk5nuvswDt-aw&bvm=bv.58187178,d.cGU">The Doomstar Requiem</a>. </p>

    <div class="col-md-6 text-justify">
      <p><strong>Skwisgaar Skwigelf</strong> discovered the guitar after first discovering his mother's  promiscuity. As described by Senator Stampingston, &quot;Her neglect helped  form the world's fastest guitarist.&quot; in the first few seasons, he is seen  using the standard ebony black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_Explorer">Gibson Explorer</a>. He switches to the <a href="http://dethklok.wikia.com/wiki/Dethklok_%22Thunderhorse%22_Explorer">Dethklok  &quot;Thunderhorse&quot; Explorer</a>,  which becomes his signature guitar for the rest of the series. He also has been  seen using the all-white <a href="http://dethklok.wikia.com/wiki/Dethklok_%22Snowhorse%22_Explorer">Dethklok  &quot;Snowhorse&quot; Explorer</a> version of the Thunderhorse, a guitar that matches Toki's all white <a href="http://dethklok.wikia.com/wiki/Brendon_Small_%22Snow_Falcon%22_Flying_V">Brendon Small  &quot;Snow Falcon&quot; Flying V</a>.  However, unlike the other guitars, the instrument has never seen a commercial  release outside of the show.<br>
        Skwisgaar Skwigelf is  Dethklok's renowned lead guitarist. He has been coined &quot;The Fastest  Guitarist Alive&quot; as he exhibits a specialty in speed scales. Skwisgaar  takes particular pride in his clean speed picking and is highly critical of the  guitar playing skills of others. His supposedly &quot;godlike&quot; abilities  are apparently the result of years of literally constant practice; an element  of humor throughout the series has been his ever-present Gibson Explorer. He is  frequently shown practicing the guitar in odd places, such as submerged in  water in the hot tub, in an elevator, while asleep, during mass, and during  meals both at home and in public. Skwisgaar repetitively practices  finger-coordination exercises on a daily basis and in an almost compulsive  manner, which can frequently be heard during Dethklok's conversations. <br>
        At one stage prior to  Toki's recruitment, Skwisgaar even expressed desire to be the bands only  guitarist as he was capable enough to carry the band on his own. As proof of  this Skwisgaar was seen able to out duel every guitarist who desired to be Dethklok's  second guitarist with the only guitarist even coming remotely close to him  being Toki. While Skwisgaar is clearly the better skilled of the two he relies  on Toki during songs to amplify his own abilities; Toki is the only one who has  ever been able to do so. <br>
        His hands have apparently  become so nimble that he has developed ambidexterity; he is sometimes shown  playing left-handed.<br>
        Not uncommon of  self-taught guitarists, he cannot read musical notation, which he blames on his  &quot;music dyslexia.&quot; Skwisgaar is a strong musical force in Dethklok; in  addition to writing songs himself, he is also responsible for the majority of  the arrangement of Dethklok's songs; he writes both the guitar lines as well as  Murderface's bass lines. Skwisgaar possess very specific knowledge on music,  songwriting and of course guitar.<br>
      As listed in the <em>Skwisgaar  Skwigelf Advanced Fast Hand Finger Wizard Master Class</em>, his Gibson Explorer  features EMG 81 and EMG 85 pickups, and his hardware includes Krank Revolution  and Krankenstein amplifiers, multiple Krank Krankenstein guitar cabinets, along  with Toki, a directly connected Line 6 PODxt effects processor, a Dunlop  Crybaby wah-pedal—Dimebag Darrell signature model, a Digitech Whammy Pedal, and  some unmentioned MXR pedals.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6 text-justify">
      <p><strong>William Murderface</strong> plays the bass guitar for the band; however, this seems rather  unnecessary, as Nathan has stated that they mix his bass out of &quot;pretty  much every song.&quot; However, Murderface improves noticeably after <a href="http://dethklok.wikia.com/wiki/Pickles">Pickles</a> introduces him to the concept of &quot;free-balling,&quot;  prompting the rest of the band to consider including his bass on their next  album. He plays a black five-string <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_Thunderbird">Gibson Thunderbird</a> Studio Bass with a white pickguard. Murderface has never written  a complete song for Dethklok, despite claiming he was the &quot;lead  songwriter&quot; in a press conference, and that his bass lines were figured  out and shown to him by Skwisgaar, which he still doesn't perform well enough  to actually merit any respect by the band. <br>
        He has a side-band called <a href="http://dethklok.wikia.com/wiki/Planet_Piss">Planet Piss</a>, with <a href="http://dethklok.wikia.com/wiki/Takin%27_It_Easy">Takin' It Easy</a> being the only real song. However, mostly due to his laziness  and lack of commitment to getting the project actually running, the side-band  never materializes beyond a concept. Murderface and Toki are the only reason  behind Dethklok's image, and without the pair Pickles, Nathan and Skwisgaar end  up writing happy songs.<br>
      Murderface has been shown  to be able to play bass fluently with and without a pick.</p>
